Description: GRAPLEr brings the power of distributing computing to the
    fingertips of lake ecology modelers. It is an R Package for connecting to
    the GRAPLE Web Service (GWS) and running GRAPLE jobs. Experiments consisting
    of thousands of simulations can be evaluated in a fraction of the time by
    submitting batches of GLM (General Lake Model) simulations to a distributed
    computing system, directly from your R/RStudio environment.
